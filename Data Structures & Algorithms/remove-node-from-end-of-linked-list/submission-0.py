        # Start both slow (s) and fast (f) at the same position (the head).

        # Move fast ahead n steps first.
        # This makes fast and slow separated by exactly n nodes.

        # Then move both pointers together, one step at a time.
        # When fast reaches the end (None), slow will be just before the node we need to remove.
        
        # PROBLEM :
        # if n == list size we have a problem
        # If we use a dummy node 
        # we keep the same algorithm but moving f n + 1 times not n
